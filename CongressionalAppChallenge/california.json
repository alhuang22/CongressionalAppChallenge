Educational institutions have an obligation to become civically engaged in order to enrich and to better society. Institutions of higher education must be ethically vigilant, consciously exploring normative and moral issues. Knowledge consists of more than facts and has more than merely utilitarian ends; knowledge pursues and reflects values. Education is immeasurably enriched by the experience and insight of those outside the educational community. Human diversity is indispensable for improving the quality and texture of the education experience. Ongoing education is a lifelong responsibility of the global community’s leaders.    Advanced education is essential for the well-being and future of an increasingly complex society. Claremont Graduate University is an independent institution, striking in its global linkages and partnerships, innovative in the ways it teaches, characterized by continuous reconfiguration, responsive in its research to social issues and needs, and sensitive to aesthetic and moral dimensions of professional life.",
